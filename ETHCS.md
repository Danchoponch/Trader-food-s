## Purpose of Data Collection
The purpose of collecting data in this project is to create a unique dataset that combines recipe ingredients from the Spoonacular API with product information from Trader Joe's. This dataset aims to assist users in meal planning by providing relevant grocery product options based on the ingredients required for specific recipes.

## Why Are You Collecting This Data?
We are collecting this data to facilitate a better understanding of the nutritional and cost aspects of meal preparation. By integrating these two data sources, users can make informed decisions about their grocery shopping, find suitable products, and enhance their overall cooking experience.

## Data Sources and Robots.txt
We respect the data sources we engage with, particularly regarding their scraping policies. We are scraping data from the Trader Joe's website, which does not prohibit web scraping in its `robots.txt` file. The absence of restrictions means that our scraping activities comply with the websiteâ€™s guidelines.

## Collection Practices
- **Limit Scraping**: We ensure that our scraping activities are limited to avoid disrupting the website's functionality. This means scraping at a reasonable rate to prevent overwhelming the server.
- **No Bypassing Password Protection**: We respect the integrity of web security and do not attempt to bypass any password protection mechanisms that may be in place.

## Data Handling and Privacy
- **No Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Our data collection strictly focuses on product information and recipe ingredients, ensuring that no user data or personally identifiable information is gathered.
- **Secure Data Storage**: If data storage is necessary, we ensure that sensitive information is handled securely. Files containing sensitive data will be added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure in public repositories.

## Data Usage
The collected data is intended solely for educational and research purposes. It will not be used for any commercial activities or distributed without appropriate permissions.

By adhering to these ethical principles, we aim to conduct our data collection and usage in a responsible and respectful manner.
